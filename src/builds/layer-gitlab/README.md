# Reactive Charm Template using Python

This is a template for a reactive charm with handlers written in Python.
It is intended for use with [charm-tools][] and the `charm create` function.



This is the default template when creating a new charm with `charm create`.
First, make sure you have [charm-tools][] installed:

```
sudo snap install charm
```

Then just run the create command:

```
charm create my-charm
```
